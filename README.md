# Development of pyGIMLi(emg3d)

Development. This repo will disappear again. Pure try-and-error. Use at your
own risk, as everything might change and nothing is granted... ;-)


## Installation

```bash
mamba env create
mamba activate pg-emg3d
python -m ipykernel install --user --name pg-emg3d
```
